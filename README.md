# Webpage-Second-level-Holberton-application
This is my First Webpage made for Holberton, using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript

This webpage includes a Header navigation section, that is defined in all the Html files as a header div. All Html files have the same
header section and the same buttons, that include a tweeter share button and a Facebook share button.

In the main sections of all the Html files you can find an article div and an aside div, in the article sections are all the principal 
content of each site, it means, cycling info, but every single Html file has a Disqus section in the aside div accompanied 
with different images of cycling. 

Finally, the footer section of every Html page content the same info and links of the header section of the webpage, and a message that
itÂ´s made for the Holberton application, additionally: in the CSS stylesheets are define the parameters for the Html pages design
(main.css  were supposed to be a style sheet to all the HTML files, but finally, I created two files, "main" "styles" CSS files), the 
jsfile is used to the unique javascript section that is an image that makes bigger when you click on it, Google fonts are used for this
project.

I hope this can be useful for you.
